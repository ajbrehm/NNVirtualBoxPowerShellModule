# NNVirtualBoxPowerShellModule
A PowerShell-based PowerShell module for VirtualBox mapping to VBoxManage.exe

There is a current (as of 2nd of January 2020) discussion of the module in the VirtualBox forums
https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=34&t=95930

Note that there is at least one other project on GitHub pursuing a similar goal. It is planned to merge NNVirtualBoxPowerShellMode and VirtualBoxPS in the future after local bugs have been ironed out.
